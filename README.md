# langevin-localization

This code is a companion for the paper:

"Projected Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithms for Constrained Sampling and Non-Convex Learning" https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12137

It implements uses the projected Langevin algorithm from that paper to implement map-based localization with a proximity sensor. The main idea is to see how method correctly samples from the posterior while respecting the constraints.
